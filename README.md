# Goal
Just make a little script for compute the equation ->

<p align=center>
    <img src=logo.png width=250px>
</p>

# How it's work ???

It's very simple, imagine two values :
```
    a = 5
    b = 5
```


Beatiful, isn't it ? And now, you need to imagine four rectangle :

<p align=center>
    <img src=draw.png width=350px>
</p>

Every rectangle have a value, the sum all the value, is equal to our equation. So at the end we have something like that:

```
    a² + b² + ( 2 * ( a * b ) )
```
